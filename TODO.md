# TODO List

- Clean up sloppy Makefiles
- Separate testing directories
	- Deterministic tests -- based on saved params
	- Deterministic test results -- for regression / unit testing
	- Non-deterministic tests on both saved params and newly generated params.
- Create a test that uses this hashing as if it were a random number generator and test its entropy.
